### HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT NUMBER ONE
# This introduces functions which are defined by the keyword 'def'
# in the form of 'def functionname(args):' where args are the arguments
# passed to the function. If we wanted to make a function named adder
# that took in two numbers named x and y, it would have the function signature of
# 'def adder(x, y): ' The colon after the arguments is VERY important
# as it lets Python know that it is the start of a block of code. A block
# is indicated by indention. Every line that belongs to a function will be indented.
# You return things from functions with, you guessed it, the return keyword.
# if I wanted to add together and return the two values from adder, x and y,
# I would use the statement 'return x + y'. Don't worry, we'll go over
# functions in GREAT detail later on, so don't panic if you're confused.

# Your assignment is to fill in the code for the functions provided.
# The functions have already been defined, for example:

### def example(x, y):
###     # your code here
###     return


# If your task was to return the result of multiplying arguments of
# the example(), the values x and y, your solution may look like:

### def example(x, y):
###     return x * y

# or it could look like:

### def example(x, y):
###     result = x * y
###     return result



### QUESTION ONE
# Given an arbitrary amount of apples as an integer,
# return back a string "Number of Apples: <count>"
# where <count> is the variable being passed in.
# The string formatting has to be exact, including spaces.
# So, question1(5) would return 'Number of Apples: 5'
def question1(count):
    
    return "Number of Apples: {count}".format(count=count)




### QUESTION TWO
# Given a persons name as the string person_name,
# return back a string that greets the person in the form of
# "Hello <person_name>, your name is <num> characters long"
# where num is the length of the string person_name.
# That means question2('John') would yield a value of
# "Hello John, your name is 4 characters long"
def question2(person_name):
    name_len = len(person_name)
    return "Hello {person_name}, your name is {name_len} characters long".format(person_name=person_name, name_len=name_len)





### QUESTION THREE
# Given two lists named list_one and list_two,
# return a new list that consists of the first
# three elements of list_one followed by the
# last element of list two. remember that you
# use [] to index things. Eg, my_var[num].
def question3(list_one, list_two):
    list_three = list_one[:3] + list_two[-1:]
    return list_three





### QUESTION FOUR
# Given an arbitrary value x (int or float), return
# a list consisting of x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5. That means
# a call of question4(3) should return [9, 27, 81, 243]
def question4(x):
    arb_list = [x ** 2, x ** 3, x ** 4, x **5]
    return arb_list





### QUESTION FIVE
# Given two strings, str_one and str_two, return the
# first three characters of str_one concatenated with
# (added to) the first three characters of str_two such
# that question5('Brad', 'Trent') will produce 'BraTre'3
# Hint: You can index strings just like you index lists.
# Extra credit: look up "slicing" and use that to solve
# this problem and question three.
def question5(str_one, str_two):
    new_str = str_one[:3] + str_two[:3]
    return new_str

## The testing function lays below. Typically we would use something called
## a unit testing library to test all our problems, but I opted to roll my own
## tests so you could see some more Python in action if you felt like looking.
## Later assignments may or may not use to a proper unit testing library
## depending on how lazy I feel on that particular day.




# We are importing the objects namedtuple and Iterable from the module collections.
# This is code that is part of the Python Standard Library that someone else has written
# for our benefit. I could have also imported these with a so-called regular import like:
# 'import collections' and then any time I needed to refer to namedtuple I could type
# collections.namedtuple, but I opted to just directly import the objects I needed.

# imported our file our code would automatically run, regardless of whether they wanted
